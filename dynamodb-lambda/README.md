# AWS DynamoDB , Lambda and CloudWatch

## Overview

Creates an AWS DynamoDB and Lambda function with the Python language bindings for CDK. Lambda function
gets triggered from a CloudWatch event every minute.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project. The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .env
directory. To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .env
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

- `cdk ls` list all stacks in the app
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk docs` open CDK documentation

Enjoy!

## The Component Structure

This Stack contains:

- a **GraphQL API** with an API Key (Use with caution, each key is only valid for 7 days.)
- a **GraphQL Schema** with Queries to get one and all items and two mutations to save and delete an item
- a **DynamoDB table** `items` that stores the data with a Pay Per Request Billing Mode
- an **IAM Role** that allows AppSync to invoke your DynamoDB table.
- an **AppSync DataSource**, connecting your API to the DynamoDB table with the previously specified role.
- a **AppSync Resolver** for a Query `getOne` to get one item from the DynamoDB table.
- a **AppSync Resolver** for a Query `all` to get all items from the DynamoDB table.
- a **AppSync Resolver** for a Mutation `save` to put an item into the DynamoDB table (the id is autogenerated, you need only name).
- a **AppSync Resolver** for a Mutation `delete` to delete one item from the DynamoDB table.
